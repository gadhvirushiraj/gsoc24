    "text": "What did I do this week?\n\nMoving LaTeX plotting\nMost of my effort week-6 went into understanding and moving the LaTeX code to its separate file from circuit.py to texrenderer.py. A separate class, TeXRenderer, was also created to further organize the code.\nUpdating the Wire Rendering of MatRenderer\nIn Week-6, I also updated the extende_wire() function for wire rendering. This change eliminated overlaping wire renderings and calls for extension of wires after each layer rendering. Now, the entire wire is only drawn at the end, after all the gates are rendered.\nBuilt a proof of Concept for Text Rendering\nAs previously mentioned, using functions from the MatRenderer class for the text renderer is the best approach for future code maintenance. During week-7, I developed a basic prototype to show how this concept works. At the moment, this prototype is implemented for the Single Qubit Gate. It effectively reuses the layer management functions in MatRenderer, specifically the manage_layers() and x_skip() functions.\n\n\nCircuit Representation Example\n{\n    top: [render for the top of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n    mid: [render for the middle of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n    bot: [render for the bottom of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n}\n\n\nBetter Examples\nExample-1\nqc = QubitCircuit(2)\nqc.add_gate(\"H\", targets=[0])\nqc.add_gate(\"RZ\", targets=[1], arg_value=0.1)\n       ┌───┐        \nq0 :───┤ H ├───\n       └───┘      \n       ┌────┐       \nq2 :───┤ RZ ├── \n       └────┘    \nThis would be stored as\n{\n    top: [\"       ┌───┐   \", \"       ┌────┐  \"],\n    mid: [\"q0 :───┤ H ├───\", \"q2 :───┤ RZ ├──\"],\n    bot: [\"       └───┘   \", \"       └────┘  \"],\n}      \n\nExample 2\nqc = QubitCircuit(1)\nqc.add_gate(\"H\", targets=[0])\nqc.add_gate(\"H\", targets=[0])\n       ┌───┐  ┌───┐ \nq0 :───┤ H ├──┤ H ├─\n       └───┘  └───┘ \nThe layer increment would look like,\n# STEP 1\n{\n    top: [\"      \"],\n    mid: [\"q0 :──\"],\n    bot: [\"      \"]\n}     \n\n# STEP 2\n{\n    top: [\"       ┌───┐ \"],\n    mid: [\"q0 :───┤ H ├─\"],\n    bot: [\"       └───┘ \"]\n} \n# STEP 1\n{\n    top: [\"       ┌───┐  ┌───┐ \"],\n    mid: [\"q0 :───┤ H ├──┤ H ├─\"],\n    bot: [\"       └───┘  └───┘ \"]\n}"

At the moment, the TextRenderer operates independently, but next step it will be integrating it with the Base-Class Renderer.\nThe rendering format follows a layer-by-layer approach. As we process each gate, we aim to place them as close to each other as possible while maintaining a clear layer structure. This method ensures that the rendered output is easy to understand. This is also the same methodology that was used in MatRenderer.\nThe rendered gates are stored as a list of strings, divided into three parts: top, middle, and bottom. Each part represents a different section of the gate, making it easier to manage.\n{\n    top: [render str for the top of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n    mid: [render str for the middle of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n    bot: [render str for the bottom of the 1st wire, 2nd wire, 3rd wire ...],\n}\n\n\nMultiQubit Gate Rendering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure below, if a gate spans qubits that have not been used as targets or controls, it does not render connections to those wires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingleQubit Gate Rendering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition of new color-theme\nIncluded three new color themes to MatRenderer:\n\nLight\n\nDark\n\nModern\n\n\nImplemented Dataclass for MatRenderer\nLast week, to handle user customization input style dictionary was implemented, which was converted to a StyleConfig dataclass. This change made our code cleaner and more organized by effectively separating customization parameters from constants.\nBugfix\nFixed, the bug spotted by Neill during rendring trotter-simulation-circuit."

    "text": "Contributions\nThe following sections review all the contributions made to the project during the GSoC ’24 coding period.\n\nBaseRenderer\nThe BaseRenderer was designed as a parent class to improve the maintainability of newly added renderers and to establish a robust framework for incorporating future renderers. By employing a layered approach, it optimizes the compactness of quantum circuits, dynamically adjusting the layout as each gate is added. This method ensures efficient space management and enhances the clarity of complex quantum operations.\nFurthermore, the BaseRenderer acts as a central hub for styling configurations through the StyleConfig class. This dataclass consolidates all customization settings, enabling consistent and streamlined styling across different renderers.\n\nNext, we will delve into the details of the two newly added renderers.\n\n\nMatRenderer\nA Matplotlib-based renderer was developed to plot complex quantum circuits, providing numerous customization options so users can adjust their circuits to meet specific needs. The features of the renderer were designed to ensure precise information delivery while maintaining visually appealing diagrams. We also prioritized compactness, arranging the circuit layout to be as optimal while maintaing the information delivery.\nExample of Results\n\n\n\nQuTiP-QIP default color-theme\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer Alignment Customization and Argument Display Option\n\n\n\n\n\nGate Bulge Customization and MultiQubit Gate Connectors for better Information Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\nDark color-theme\n\n\n\nFurther Details about MatRenderer\nThe MatRenderer offers four distinct color themes: qutip, dark, light, and modern. Users can personalize these themes further through styling configurations. They can also choose between the modern bulge style and the classic box style for gate appearances. The renderer enhances clarity with connectors for MultiQubit Gates and an option to display arguments.\nMatRenderer also provides extensive customization options. Users can adjust wire labeling, background color, font family, font size, and more, creating a highly personalized and visually appealing representation of quantum circuits.\n\n\n\nTextRenderer\nNowadays, most users rely on Matplotlib. However, users who interact with libraries through the terminal require a different type of renderer. TextRender is ideal for those using the terminal or for quick circuit checks to ensure the library correctly interprets their intentions. The TextRenderer has fewer customization options compared to the MatRenderers, but it still provides some level of customization.\nExample of Results\n        ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐  ┌───────┐  ┌───┐   \n

    "text": "Given the lack of direct methods to test the correctness of rendered circuits, I had to employ various combinations and scenarios to identify any breaking points in the code or logic. This week, I encountered and resolved two significant issues:\n\nRendering Logic Flaw for Custom Gates with Multiple Control Nodes: I identified a flaw in the rendering logic for custom gates that involved multiple control wires and worked on fixing this issue to ensure proper visualization.\nDynamic Gate Sizing with Text Input: There was a previously mentioned problem with dynamically adjusting gate sizes when text input was involved. This issue has also been resolved, ensuring that gate sizes adjust correctly based on the text they contain.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal for this week was to integrate styling customization with the current gate class and implement the global-dense option to allow users to shrink the size of the circuit.\nCurrently, the gate class accepts a styling dictionary as input with the following customization parameters:\n\ntext: Custom gate label\ncolor: Controls gate background color\nfontsize: Size of the text\nfontcolor: Controls the font color of the text\nfontweight: Controls the weight of the font styles | “bold”, “normal” (default) | custom value\nfontfamily: ‘serif’ | ‘sans-serif’ | ‘cursive’ | ‘fantasy’ | ‘monospace’ (default)\nfontname: Custom font integration (yet to test)\n\nHere is an example of user customization options: \n\n\n\nThe global-dense feature, specified by the condense argument in the MatRenderer class, allows users to shrink the size of the circuit. The images below demonstrate the default setting and the condense = 0.1 setting, respectively:\n \n\n\n\nAnother important improvement was the addition of connectors for multi-qubit gates. In cases where there are multiple targets of a multi-qubit gate, connectors are added to the gate graphic to identify which wire it is connecting to. This ensures clarity, especially when the gate is drawn over wires it is not connected to. Example can be seen in above “BERKELEY” Gate.\n\n\n\n\nAdd option to display gate argument in label\nmultiline row support for gate label\nMake a Draft PR\nNotebook Tutorials\nFind / Fix bugs"

By eliminating the need for external dependencies such as LaTeX and ImageMagick, the new rendering modules will simplify the installation and setup process for users. This will make QuTiP more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for those who may not be familiar with setting up these additional tools.\nAdditionally, the introduction of a Matplotlib-based renderer will enhance the visual appeal of quantum circuit diagrams, making it easier for researchers and developers to interpret and share their work. The ASCII text-based renderer will provide a lightweight and efficient option for command-line interactions, ensuring that users have a versatile set of tools to suit their different working environments.\nBy providing a Circuit Renderer Selector, users will have the flexibility to choose the most suitable rendering method for their needs, enhancing their overall experience with QuTiP. Ultimately, this project will enable users to visualize quantum circuits more efficiently and effectively, facilitating better understanding and communication of quantum algorithms and operations."

This effort involved revisiting the existing code, refactoring where necessary, and ensuring that all features work seamlessly across different rendering contexts.\nAdded more test cases\nTo ensure the robustness of the recent changes, additional test cases were written and integrated into our test suite. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the BaseRenderer, along with its compatible renderers, performs as expected across various use cases.\nExplored Different Test Cases for MatRenderer\nWe investigated various methods for testing matplotlib-plotted figures. Three main approaches were considered:\n\nJust Check for Errors:\nSimply execute the plotting code and pass the test if no errors or warnings are raised. This is the bare minimum test we can perform.\nImage Comparison:\nSave a correct plot and compare the generated plot against it, allowing for some inaccuracy using matplotlib testing function’s fetaure tolerance. Negatives of storing multiple images, dimension challenges, extension challenges.\nManual Comparison:\nCompare the generated plot with manually constructed ones using matplotlib’s low-level interfaces like patches and draw lines."
